i started out with a prompt in v0: i want to create a iMessage-like blog

then i added: the blog should be written in blue bubbles, like in iMessage

and pasted an image saying that it should have a similar feel to it

that was enough for v0 to start

then i downloaded all the files that v0 generated. created a github repo, copy-pasted the files into the repo and opened Cursor and github desktop

i had to ask cursor to fix the code for me a couple of times

tab tab tab. accept all

commit to main

voila

    content: `this is how we did it (part 1)

we started building circular october 11th 2024

we had go-live with our first paying customer december 31th 

how is that possible?

let's start with the tech stuff

we did a concious choice of not spending any time setting up our own infra

everything is serverless and as-a-service

and we're utilizing good, flexible, secure and future proof frameworks

This is our stack <br />
🔮 Framework: Next js <br />
⚡️ Database: Supabase <br />
🔐 Auth: Supabase <br />
🚩 State management: TanStack <br />
📋 ORM: Drizzle <br />
📧 Emails: Resend <br />
💻 UI: Shadcn <br />
✨ AI: OpenAI + Gemini <br />
👨🏻‍🎨 Design: Figma <br />
⚫️ Backlog: Linear <br />
🛰️ Hosting: Vercel <br />
💶 Payments: Stripe

to build fast without burning cash, we also used some different AI tools

that supercharges the development speed. Like having a large team of offshore devs at your fingertips

this is the AI stack <br />
✔️ Generative UI: v0 <br />
▶️ IDE: Cursor <br />
✨ Coding assistant: OpenAI o1 <br />
👾 Rapid prototyping: Databutton

this is the tech foundating we build upon to build at speed
