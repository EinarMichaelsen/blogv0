i started out with a prompt in v0: i want to create a iMessage-like blog

then i added: the blog should be written in blue bubbles, like in iMessage

and pasted an image saying that it should have a similar feel to it

that was enough for v0 to start

then i downloaded all the files that v0 generated. created a github repo, copy-pasted the files into the repo and opened Cursor and github desktop

i had to ask cursor to fix the code for me a couple of times

tab tab tab. accept all

commit to main

voila
