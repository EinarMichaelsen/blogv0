    content: `this is how we did it (part 1)

we started building circular october 11th 2024

we had go-live with our first paying customer december 31th 

how is that possible?

let's start with the tech stuff

we did a concious choice of not spending any time setting up our own infra

everything is serverless and as-a-service

and we're utilizing good, flexible, secure and future proof frameworks

this is our stack <br />
🔮 framework: Next js <br />
⚡️ database: Supabase <br />
🔐 auth: Supabase <br />
🚩 state management: TanStack <br />
📋 ORM: Drizzle <br />
📧 emails: Resend <br />
💻 ui: Shadcn <br />
✨ ai: OpenAI + Gemini <br />
👨🏻‍🎨 design: Figma <br />
⚫️ backlog: Linear <br />
🛰️ hosting: Vercel <br />
💶 payments: Stripe

to build fast without burning cash, we also used some different AI tools

that supercharges the development speed. Like having a large team of offshore devs at your fingertips

this is the AI stack <br />
✔️ Generative UI: v0 <br />
▶️ IDE: Cursor <br />
✨ Coding assistant: OpenAI o1 <br />
👾 Rapid prototyping: Databutton

this is the tech foundating we build upon to build at speed`

    content: `this is kinda the part 2 of "how we built a b2b saas in 81 days"

a bit more abstract than the tech stack, but just as important for delivering on quality and speed

you can just do things

^that is what we try to live by at Circular

it's very simple, yet incredibly difficult

an excessive focus on perfection is often the biggest obstacle to actually getting things done

at Circular we have a bias towards action <br />
⚡️ we do <br />
⚡️ we deliver <br /> 
⚡️ we fail <br />
⚡️ we learn <br />
⚡️ we improve

that allows us to move fast and build great products—products that keep getting better and better

these are the values at Circular

🛠️ execution 🛠️ <br />
we believe in action. We have a strong action bias. We move fast, fail quickly, learn, and iterate

⚠️ risk ⚠️ <br />
we take risks. If nothing ever fails, we're not innovating enough

📣 clarity 📣 <br />
we value clear expectations and communication. Information should be transparent and accessible

❤️ empathy ❤️ <br />
we listen to our customers' challenges. Our most important task is always to create value for them`

    content: `let's call this blog part 3 of how we built a b2b saas in 81 days

To maintain momentum and progress, two things are essential

🎯 Focus

🫡 Prioritization

Focus is constantly challenged by new ideas and opportunities.

🍏 Golden apples, as Christina Wodtke calls them in Radical Focus. Tempting distractions. Short-term opportunities that can pull us away from our long-term goals. Seemingly attractive options that slow down progress.

Being good at prioritization and maintaining focus has been one of the biggest challenges in building Circular

So, how do we work to stay focused?

OKRs and weekly priorities

Monthly OKRs:

⭐ One objective to set the direction.

✅ Three key results to measure whether we have achieved our objective.

Weekly priorities:

📋 Each week, we create a list of up to five priorities.

Only priorities that move the needle on our key results make the list.

This means we have to leave exciting ideas and opportunities on the table—no matter how tempting they are.

This is the hardest part for me. There are so many exciting things we could do. So many ideas and opportunities. But we (unfortunately) can't do everything at once.

One model for prioritization is the New Opportunity Test

If it doesn't fit within our priorities for the week

it's a no.

If it's not a hell yes

it's a no.

And it has to create value

ideally a lot of value

    content: `let explore why resale is exciting

with Circular, we aim for global impact.

we target the underserved brick-and-mortar part of resale

surprisingly, in-store (offline) resale accounts for more than 50% of the global resale market

even though online gets most of the fuzz

so, why is the resale market exciting? and why now?

a perfect storm of regulatory, consumer, and technological shifts is propelling the secondhand market into a transformative wave

𐄷 regulations 𐄷 <br />
Policies like Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and Digital Product Passports (DPP) require producers to manage their products throughout their lifecycle and make data accessible

🛍️ consumer trends 🛍️ <br />
secondhand shopping has gone mainstream, driven by eco-conscious consumers

🏠 retail trends 🏠 <br />
brick and mortar is coming back. Even D2C companies are establishing physical presence to create meaningful customer relationships and shopping experiences

🤖 technology 🤖 <br />
advancements in AI helps us automating manual and time consuming tasks tasks, making circular retail scalable

⏱️ internal efficiency gains ⏱️  <br />
AI also reduces costs and speeds up the development of scalable B2B SaaS solutions

Europe has more than 75,000 secondhand stores

contributing to a global resale market worth $265 billion

this is a market that is growing at 12% CAGR

offline resale accounts for over half of the market

we are positioning Circular to be the winner in this market`

    doing vibe coding only

i started out with a prompt in v0: i want to create a iMessage-like blog

then i added: the blog should be written in blue bubbles, like in iMessage

and pasted an image saying that it should have a similar feel to it

that was enough for v0 to start

then i downloaded all the files that v0 generated. created a github repo, copy-pasted the files into the repo and opened Cursor and github desktop

i had to ask cursor to fix the code for me a couple of times

tab tab tab. accept all

commit to main

voila
